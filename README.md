# Azure-104-Course

This repository contains a small code project and related materials I worked on while completing the Microsoft Learn AZ-104: Microsoft Azure Administrator course, specifically the "deploying ARM templates using a .JSON file" module. It includes the template file, and screenshots from the terminal and azure portal to show what the output should look like when deployed correctly.

To deploy the ARM template, activate a Microsoft Learn Sandbox, then use a cmd prompt or powershell and follow these steps:

Make sure to replace {your-unique-name} with your actual unique azure id (only using lowercase letters and numbers).

You may have to replace "azuredeploy.json" with the file path if the azuredeploy file is not in the same directory.
